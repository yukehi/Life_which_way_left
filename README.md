# Life_which_way_left_for_us
The main thinking for the game is the fear of falling, the metaphor is that life is an endless loop of ups and downs, when you choose which direction you went to move the stage will be built according to your choice of movement whether it is up or down, the game itself is based on the mechanics of jumping between different pillars at the end of which you arrive For a denser path and it becomes uniform, the goal is to find this path when you don't have a compass.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The loop will be that every time you don't land on the next surface, you are dropped directly to the initial stage which is the beginning of the game and you have to find your way out again.

The initial stage starts flat and there are flat pillars, the player starts in his center and chooses where to go, according to this decision the stage will start to be built whether uphill or downhill, the player's goal is to find the right direction where the pillars will start to shrink and eventually become one uniform path and the end of the game, Every surface that the player lands on the score, as he progresses in the score, the stage will also be built to be more limited and will guide him with hints as to where the uniform path is, additionally there were some elements of difficulty for the player in the columns

Earthquakes - moving columns (mechanics)
Rain - reducing the area of resistance (mechanics)
Ice - permanent sliding (material)
Fire - impossibility of landing on the surface (material)
There were power-ups to be given to the player

Spring shoes - will give a jump for a greater distance

Flying shoes - if you fell to jump high, go back to the stage where you fell

Back in time - will take one step back

Compass - will show the way to where
